# PistonScan

PistonScan is an IP scanning toolkit that will evolve into a full-featured application.

## Getting Started

```bash
go run ./cmd/pistonscan open
```

The current implementation sets up the command-line interface and a placeholder `open` command. Core scanning functionality will be added in future iterations.
